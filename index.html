  "Stay focused and never give up.",
  "Hard work beats talent when talent doesn't work hard.",
  "Success doesn’t come from what you do occasionally, it comes from what you do consistently.",
  "Make each day your masterpiece.",
  "Doubt kills more dreams than failure ever will.",
  "Act as if what you do makes a difference. It does.",
  "Keep going. Everything you need will come to you at the perfect time.",
  "You don’t have to be great to start, but you have to start to be great.",
  "It always seems impossible until it’s done.",
  "Small progress is still progress.",
  "If you're going through hell, keep going.",
  "Don't stop until you're proud.",
  "Be stronger than your excuses."
